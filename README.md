# OCT-and-Chest-X-Ray-Images
Computer Vision

Data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3

The dataset contains thousands of validated OCT and Chest X-Ray images described and analyzed in "Identifying Medical Diagnoses and
Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning". The images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. 
OCT images are labeled and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
Chest X-Ray images are labeled and split into 2 directories: PNEUMONIA and NORMAL.

Our aim is to build classification models which can classify any new OCT or Chest X-Ray images into their correct category based on the 
patterns learned from the training images.
